# Route360° Angular Library
Since we mostly develop our apps with Angular we also developed a public library which should be very helpful. Please keep in mind that this library is in a very early stage and is subject to change on any given day. We are working on making a stable build und write the documentation, but this will take some time. :/ 
You can find the library [here](https://github.com/route360/r360-angular).


# Bower
You can use our project in bower

    bower install route360 --save
